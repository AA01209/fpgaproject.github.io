# 3. Implementation

## Block design

Below is the block diagram of the project, a better overview can be found in

## Debouncer  
The debouncing circuit used for mechanical switches/ buttons cause an unpredictable
bounce in the signal when toggled. There are various ways to implement debouncing
circuits for buttons on FPGA. 
In this project, a two debouncing circuits are implemented in Verilog,
the first one used to generate only a single pulse when pressing a button
on FPGA and the second one used to generate only a single pulse when switching
the switches on FPGA Boolean board.

## Seven segment Display

## Simulation (Time diagram)

The modules were tested separately where each one of them has its own testbench.
The following waveform screenshots for servo_control and seven_segment_display
modules show the correctness of the circuit functionalities. And regarding other modules, 
it is preferable to simulate them locally since the range of the inputs is high.
